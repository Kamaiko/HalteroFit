# TODO(Phase 2+): Configure EAS Preview Builds
# ============================================================================
# This workflow is currently DISABLED (workflow_dispatch only).
# It will be configured in Phase 2+ when features are stable enough for QA.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Build EAS Development/Preview builds for QA testing
#   - Triggered on PRs with label "needs-qa" or manual dispatch
#   - Posts QR code in PR comments for easy device installation
#
# Why not enabled now (Phase 0.5):
#   - Infrastructure is still changing frequently
#   - Would waste EAS build limits (30 builds/month on free tier)
#   - Manual builds (eas build) are sufficient for now
#
# When to enable:
#   - Phase 2+: When features are stable and QA testing becomes regular
#   - Suggested frequency: 2-3 builds/week max (not every commit)
# ============================================================================

on:
  # Manual trigger only - no automatic builds yet
